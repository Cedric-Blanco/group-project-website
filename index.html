                <h2>Crafty</h2>
                <p>Brian May's guitar was homemade. Originally, he was going to buy a guitar, but could not 
                    afford a guitar at the time. For example, the guitar's wooden body was made using 
                    wood from an old oak table, and the neck had wood from a fireplace mantel.

                <h2>Mastermind Behind the Scenes</h2>
                <p>John Deacon, the bass guitarist, was very quiet and preferred to not be on the spotlight.
                    However, he had a big impact on Queen's success for laying the foundation for some
                    of the band's big hits. Two examples are "Another One Bites the Dust" and "I Want to Break Free".

                <h2>From Guitar to Drums</h2>
                <p>Roger Taylor, the drummer for queen, had originally played guitar and ukulele
                    before moving onto the drums. He learned the two first, before switching
                    mastering the drums at 15 since he had a more natural feel for them.

                <h2>Michael Jackson Influence</h2>
                <p>Originally, <i>Another One Bites the Dust</i> was not meant to be released as a single.
                    Michael Jackson played a factor into pushing the band to release the song as a single
                    after hearing it backstage by telling Freddie "You need a song that makes the cats dance."

                <h2>Genesis or Queen</h2>
                <p>Before joining Queen, Roger Taylor had the opportunity to join Genesis. It was indirect, but according
                    to Roger, that was the impression he got since he was invited to the studio.He declined with a reason stating 
                    that the music they created wasn't really aligned to what he wanted to create.

                <h2>Under Pressure Even in the Studio</h2>
                <p>The production of the song <i>Under Pressure</i> had the band collaborate with David Bowie,
                who just happened to be in Switzerland while Queen was there as well. As great as the song was,
                David and Freddie would happen to be in heated arguments or conflicts during the process.</p>
